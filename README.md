#### {this is a Triangle Tracker},{10th August 2018}
#### By **{David Ngatia}**
## Description
{Triton allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. .}
## Expectations
* Equilateral: All sides are equal.
* Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
* Scalene: No sides are equal.
* NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.}
## Technologies Used
{I used HTML and CSS/STYLES, TERMINAL AND ATOM.}
